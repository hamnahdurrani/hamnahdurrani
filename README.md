## Projects Overview
### Cloud Storage Manager _(React, Vite, AWS (Amplify, S3, IAM), CSS, TypeScript)_
  - Engineered a cloud-based file management web app enabling secure file uploads, downloads, deletions, and dynamic file listing using AWS S3 and Amplify Storage module.
  - Integrated pre-signed URLs for secure file downloads and implemented full S3 path control to ensure safe and flexible data access.
  - Designed a responsive and intuitive interface with React and TypeScript, providing real-time file updates and metadata display (file size, last modified).

### Text Editor _(C++, Qt, CMake)_
  - Built a lightweight text editor replicating core Notepad functionality, supporting file operations and real-time text editing for .txt files.
  - Designed a clean and responsive GUI using Qt 6 Widgets, featuring an integrated toolbar and menu bar for intuitive user navigation.
  - Implemented keyboard shortcuts, editing features such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Redo, Find, and Undo, and file operations such as Open, New and Save As, enhancing editing speed and    accessibility.
### Connect Four _(Python , Tkinter(GUI))_
  - Developed game logic with real-time state updates for two-player turn-based gameplay
  - Created a  user interface with color-changing discs and win/lose notifications
### Flappy Bird Clone _(Java, Swing (GUI))_
  - Dynamic game environment with score trackeDeveloped a Flappy Bird clone  showcasing smooth animation, real-time collision detection, and continuous game loop management.
  - Implemented randomized obstacle generation (pipes) and score tracking, creating dynamic and progressively challenging gameplay.
  - Handled user input to control the birdâ€™s movement, detect game-over events, and enable restart functionality via the spacebar.
  - Applied object-oriented programming principles for maintainable code with separate classes managing player, pipes, and game environment.
### Restaurant Website _(JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Express)_
  - Implemented functional user interactions including a homepage promotion popup, an intro video autoplay, hover animations for menu items, and a navigation bar for smooth user experience.
  - Developed a backend that allows users to select preferred dates and times, book tables directly through the website, and view real-time availability.
  - Built a newsletter subscription system and integrated social media links and Google Maps directions for streamlined customer engagement.
  - Wrote unit tests using JUnit to validate backend reservation logic, ensuring reliable table booking functionality and handling of edge cases.
### Tic-Tac-Toe _(Python)_
 - Implemented a two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python with a 3x3 grid, turn-based logic, and win/tie detection
